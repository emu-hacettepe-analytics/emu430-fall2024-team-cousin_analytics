# Our Project

**Title:** `Analysis of Key Performance Indicators and Squad Market Values Impacting Rankings in Turkey’s Süper Lig: A Focus on Shooting Accuracy, Possession, and Goals (2015-2024)`

**Description:**\
This project analyzes how key performance indicators—such as average shots, average shots on target, average ball possession, average goals scored, average goals conceded, squad market values, and team rankings—have influenced the performance of Turkey's top football teams in the Süper Lig over the past 9 seasons (2015-2024). The study examines the relationships between offensive and defensive metrics, market value of players, and their direct impact on league rankings. By incorporating squad market values, the project explores how a team's financial strength and player quality contribute to overall success. Key visualizations, including trend analysis, bar chart races, and correlation graphs, illustrate the effect of these variables on team performance. The analysis aims to uncover patterns of success, identify underperforming areas, and provide actionable insights into the factors most strongly determining a team’s position in the league standings.
