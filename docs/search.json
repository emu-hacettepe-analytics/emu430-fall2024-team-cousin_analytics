The study examines the relationships between offensive and defensive metrics, market value of players, and their direct impact on league rankings. By incorporating squad market values, the project explores how a team’s financial strength and player quality contribute to overall success. Key visualizations, including trend analysis, bar chart races, and correlation graphs, illustrate the effect of these variables on team performance. The analysis aims to uncover patterns of success, identify underperforming areas, and provide actionable insights into the factors most strongly determining a team’s position in the league standings.\n\n\nData Set\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
