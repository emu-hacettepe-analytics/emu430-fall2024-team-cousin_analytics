The study examines the relationships between offensive and defensive metrics, market value of players, and their direct impact on league rankings. By incorporating squad market values, the project explores how a team’s financial strength and player quality contribute to overall success. Key visualizations, including trend analysis, bar chart races, and correlation graphs, illustrate the effect of these variables on team performance. The analysis aims to uncover patterns of success, identify underperforming areas, and provide actionable insights into the factors most strongly determining a team’s position in the league standings.\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\nData Set\nTurkish Super League Stats for top 4 teams, The period between 2015-2016 and 2023-2024,,\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nMost Important Factors: Goals scored and goals conceded are the most important factors for determining rankings. A strong attacking ability (scoring goals) combined with a solid defense (conceding fewer goals) are the key to maintaining or improving a team’s league position.\nSecondary Factors: Ball possession and squad market value have a secondary role. While they contribute to team performance, they do not directly drive rankings as effectively as offensive and defensive performance. Possession might help control the tempo of a game, and squad market value can aid in acquiring top talent, but these factors are less directly linked to achieving top rankings in the league.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

This suggests that higher ball possession is associated with better league performance, but the relationship is not very strong. Weak Correlation:\nA correlation value of -0.3174 shows a weak relationship between the two variables. Ball possession alone does not significantly determine league rankings. Conclusion:\nWhile ball possession plays a role in improving rankings, other factors such as goals scored, goals conceded, and defensive or offensive efficiency likely have a stronger influence on the overall performance.\nSummary:\n\nNegative Correlation (-0.3174): Higher ball possession is linked to better rankings, but the relationship is weak.\nWeak Influence: Ball possession alone has limited impact on rankings compared to factors like goals scored and conceded.\nConclusion: Ball possession contributes to performance but is less significant than other metrics."

As squad market values increase, rankings tend to improve, but the relationship is not strong.\nWhile higher squad market values are linked to better performance, other factors like team strategy, player performance, and injuries are likely more significant. This also aligns with Johan Cruyff’s quote: “I’ve never seen a bag of money score a goal.” This suggests that while financial resources can support success, they do not guarantee it without proper execution on the field."
